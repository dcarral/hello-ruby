# hello-ruby

Here you can find the material for the **“Ruby 101”** session @ SoCraTes Canaries 2017.

## Goal

(Briefly) introduce the Ruby programming language and set up a development environment which can be leveraged for tomorrow's session on **clean code** & **code quality**.

## Agenda

1. Intro
2. Set up development environment
3. Hands-on basic TDD example
4. You say :-)

## Slidedeck and all that jazz?

I've just shamelessly grabbed and adapted part of the material we used when running a “Web development with Ruby” workshop @ the University of Oviedo in 2015.

All the credit goes to my ex-colleagues @ Sweetspot Intelligence: [@pablorc](https://github.com/pablorc), [@sergioalvz](https://github.com/sergioalvz) & [@dgsuarez](https://github.com/dgsuarez).

Full workshop material can be still found @ https://github.com/ruby-uniovi ;)
