# hello-ruby

Here you can find the material for the “Ruby 101” session @ SoCraTes Canaries 2017.

## Goals

- Introduce the Ruby programming language.
- Set up a development environment: should come handy for tomorrow's session on **clean code** & **code quality**.

## Slidedeck and all that jazz?

I've just shamelessly grabbed and adapted part of the material we used when running a “Web development with Ruby” workshop @ the University of Oviedo in 2015.

All the credit goes to my ex-colleagues @ Sweetspot Intelligence: [@pablorc](https://github.com/pablorc), [@sergioalvz](https://github.com/sergioalvz) & [@dgsuarez](https://github.com/dgsuarez).

Full workshop material can be still found @ https://github.com/ruby-uniovi ;)
